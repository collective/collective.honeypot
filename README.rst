Use cases
=========

Spammers have found you and are pounding various forms on your
website.  Prime victims are the join form, contact form, sendto form
and comment form.

Maybe you have some captcha protection in place but spammers have
found a way around it.  Or you want to detect a spammer before doing a
possibly time consuming validation.

You have noticed that some scripts send e-mails or add a comment even
when they receive a ``GET`` instead of a ``POST`` request.

You do not want to put up any user unfriendly captchas, but do not
want to make it easy for spammers either.

Or, rather differently, you wonder if you can temporarily disallow all
``POST`` requests while you are doing a big migration.


Idea
====

One anti-spam idea that has found adoption is a honeypot: adding a
field that would never be filled in by a human.  The reasoning is that
spammers will likely fill in all fields in a form, for two reasons:

1. The bots do not know which fields are required, so they
   fill everything in, just to be sure.

2. After a successful submission, each field might be shown on the
   website, so they fill all fields to get their message in the face
   of unsuspecting visitors.

The field should be hidden so it does not distract humans.  But:
making the input type hidden could mean that a spammer ignores it and
does not fill it in after all, so we hide it with css instead.

Some spambots seem to know a bit about Plone.  They know which fields
are required on a few forms in a standard Plone website without
captchas, or they even know a way around validation.  If we add an
invisible field they will simply not use it.  So: for a few explicitly
selected forms we require that the invisible field is in the submitted
form, although it must be empty.


Installation and usage
======================

Add ``collective.honeypot`` to the eggs of your zope instance in your
buildout config::

  [instance]
  eggs =
      collective.honeypot

In Plone 3.2 or lower (untested) you need to add it to the zcml option
as well::

  [instance]
  eggs =
      collective.honeypot
  zcml =
      collective.honeypot

Run buildout and start the zope instance.

At this point it does not do anything yet, except that it logs some
info whenever someone does a ``POST``.  You should take some measures to
make it actually protect forms.  Every form that you want to protect,
needs a change.  You can do that yourself and/or load the standard
fixes from ``collective.honeypot``.

``collective.honeypot`` has fixes for a few standard Plone templates.
If you want to use them, you need to explicitly enable them.  How?


Activation on Plone 3
---------------------

Go to the Add-ons (Extra Products) control panel in your Plone Site
and activate ``collective.honeypot``.

What does this do?

- This adds a few skin layers that override several templates and
  scripts.

Two notes:

- We add the skin layers after the ``custom`` skin layer, so if you
  have customized a skin script or template that we want to override,
  then you should take over the changes in your customization.

- If you have installed ``quintagroup.plonecomments``, then you need
  to change the order of the skin layers.  Go to the Zope Management
  Interface, then to Properties tab of the ``portal_skins`` tool.  In
  all skin selections put ``honeypot_quinta`` at the first spot behind
  ``custom``.  Specifically, it should be above
  ``honeypot_oldcomments`` and ``quintagroup_plonecomments``.

Alternatively you could add ``z3c.jbot`` to the eggs and load our
``fixes.zcml`` in an own package (on Plone 3 this is not possible in a
buildout config).  This used to be the only way, but ``z3c.jbot`` on
Plone 3 gives problems with some packages.  Problems have been noted
in combination with ``Products.CacheSetup`` and with Plone Go Mobile.


Activation on Plone 4
---------------------

You have two options: do the same as on Plone 3, or load some extra
``zcml`` to have the fixes available without needing any actions in
the Plone UI.  The last one is recommended.  It also offers an extra
fix.

The best option is to load the extra ``fixes`` dependencies
(``z3c.jbot`` currently) and loading ``fixes.zcml``.  In your Plone 4
buildout config::

  [instance]
  eggs =
      collective.honeypot[fixes]
  zcml =
      collective.honeypot-fixes

What does this do?

- This registers overrides for several templates and scripts (using
  ``z3c.jbot``).

- It adds those templates and scripts to the list of extra protected
  actions.  This means that a ``POST`` request to these actions now
  **must** have the honeypot field and it **must** be empty.


Fixes
=====

You need to enable the fixes.  See `Installation and usage`_ for how
to do that.

Well, we always change the ``@@authenticator`` view, even if you do
not enable the fixes, but that should not have any adverse effect.

Some scripts in standard Plone happily add a comment or send an e-mail
when you use a ``GET`` request.  This package does not agree with that
policy and has fixes to require a ``POST`` request.

When using ``z3c.jbot``, the package detects which fixes are needed.
Plone 3 and 4 need other fixes.  Some add-ons may or may not be
available, so we only load fixes that can be applied, especially for
``plone.app.discussion`` and ``quintagroup.plonecomments``.

If you override a script or template in an own skin layer or via some
zcml, then our fixes may have no effect, so you need to do a fix
yourself.

So, what are the actual fixes that this package contains?

- Some forms may get the invisible honeypot field automatically.  This
  package registers an override for the ``@@authenticator`` view from
  ``plone.protect`` that is used in several templates for csrf
  protection (cross site request forgery).  So any template that
  already uses this, is automatically loading our honeypot field.

- ``plone.app.discussion``:

  - Add the honeypot field to the 'add comment' form.  This fix is
    only done when you load ``fixes.zcml``.

  - The honeypot field is *not* required, because the 'add comment'
    form posts to the context, not to a specific action.

- old comments:

  - This is the standard commenting system of Plone 3.3 and 4.0.  It
    is still available in newer Plone versions, so we always load
    these fixes.

  - Add the honeypot field to the 'add comment' form
    (``discussion_reply_form``).

  - Require ``POST`` for the ``discussion_reply`` script.

  - Require the honeypot field in the ``discussion_reply`` action.
    Note: we cannot require it in ``discussion_reply_form``, because
    any page that allows adding comments will contain a simple form
    with this action and a single button 'Add Comment' to open the
    real form.  That initial form will not have our honeypot field.

- ``quintagroup.plonecomments``:

  - This is the only add-on that we add a fix for, because we believe
    it is widely used in Plone 3 and 4.0.  The tests have been done
    with ``quintagroup.plonecomments`` version 4.1.9.

  - Note that ``quintagroup.plonecomments`` 4.1.9 does not seem to
    work in Plone versions 4.1 and higher, which of course have
    ``plone.app.discussion``.  This has nothing to do with
    ``collective.honeypot``.  Maybe it works if you uninstall
    ``plone.app.discussion``, but this is not recommended.

  - For ``quintagroup.plonecomments`` we have the same fixes as for
    the old comments.

- Plone 4:

  - Require ``POST`` for the ``send_feedback_site`` and ``sendto``
    scripts.

  - Add the honeypot field to the ``sendto_form`` and ``contact-info``
    forms.

  - The register form is automatically protected by our
    ``@@authenticator`` override.

  - Require the honeypot field for the above actions and the join
    form, specifically: ``sendto_form``, ``sendto``, ``contact-info``,
    ``send_feedback_site``, ``register``, ``join_form``.

- Plone 3:

  - We have the same fixes as for Plone 4.

  - We also require the honeypot field on the ``join_form`` action.
    Note that in Plone 4 the ``join_form`` only exists under the name
    ``register``.

  - We allow skin scripts and templates to use ``from zExceptions
    import Forbidden``.  In Plone 4 this is already allowed.  We need
    this to be able to use ``raise Forbidden('Use POST please.')`` in
    form actions.


Protecting your own forms
=========================

In a form that you want to protect, you must add this::

  <div tal:replace="structure context/@@honeypot_field|nothing" />

This is all that is needed to have the basic protection of an
invisible field that captures spammers if they fill it in.  A
``Forbidden`` exception is raised in that case.

Some forms may get this invisible field automatically.  This package
registers an override for the ``@@authenticator`` view from
``plone.protect`` that is used in several templates for csrf
protection (cross site request forgery).  So any template that already
uses this, is automatically loading our honeypot field.

For extra protection, you can add the page on which the form appears
to the ``EXTRA_PROTECTED_ACTIONS``.  This means that the ``Forbidden``
exception is also raised if the field is not submitted in the form at
all.  See the Configuration_ section.

Note that it would be nice to accept all posts from authenticated
users, but our code is run too early in the Zope process: we cannot
know yet if the user is logged in or not.


Configuration
=============

There is no configuration that you can do within a Plone Site.  That
would be too easy to get wrong, possibly even disabling the means to
undo the damage.  Also, with multiple Plone Sites in one Zope instance
this would get even trickier.  So we chose a different approach.

You can configure settings via environment variables in the
``zope.conf`` of your zope instance.  For testing you could set an
environment variable in your command shell and start the zope instance
and it will get picked up.  But the usual way would be to do this in
``buildout.cfg``::

  [instance]
  environment-vars =
      HONEYPOT_FIELD pooh
      EXTRA_PROTECTED_ACTIONS discussion_reply join_form sendto_form
      WHITELISTED_ACTIONS jq_reveal_email
      WHITELISTED_START jq_*
      IGNORED_FORM_FIELDS secret_field
      ACCEPTED_LOG_LEVEL info
      SPAMMER_LOG_LEVEL error
      DISALLOW_ALL_POSTS no

General notes:

- None of the options are required.  It will work fine without any
  environment variables.

- Values are split on whitespace or comma.

- Any ``@`` character gets automatically replaced by a space, to make
  it easier to reference ``@@some_view`` by simply ``some_view``, as
  we always protect them both.

These are the supported variables:

HONEYPOT_FIELD
    Name to use as input name of the honeypot field.  If you give no
    value here, no honeypot checks are done, so you only get some
    logging.  This is obviously not the main goal of this package, but
    it may be useful when you need to do some debugging.  If you do
    not list the variable, you get the default value of
    ``protected_1``.  In case spammers learn about this package and do
    not fill in the standard name, you can change the name here.

EXTRA_PROTECTED_ACTIONS
    For these form actions the honeypot field is required: the field
    **must** be in the posted request, though it of course still **must**
    be empty.  If you add actions here but do not change the forms,
    they become unusable for visitors, which is not what you want.  On
    the other hand, if you have a form that you no longer wish to use,
    you can add it here and it will stop functioning.  For ``@@view``
    simply use ``view`` and it will match both.

WHITELISTED_ACTIONS
    These form actions are not checked.  List here actions that are
    harmless, for example actions that load some data via an AJAX
    call.  Generally, actions that change nothing in the database and
    do not send emails are safe to add here.  If you add this
    environment variable but leave it empty, you override the
    default and do not whitelist anything.  By default we whitelist
    these actions:

    - ``at_validate_field`` (inline validation)

    - ``atct_edit`` (edit form)

    - ``edit`` (edit form)

    - ``kssValidateField`` (inline validation)

    - ``jq_reveal_email`` (``zest.emailhider``)

    - ``z3cform_validate_field``  (inline validation)



WHITELISTED_START
    Form actions starting with one of these strings are not checked.
    See ``WHITELISTED_ACTIONS`` for more info.  If you have lots of
    harmless actions that start with ``jq_`` you can add that string
    to this list.  Regular expression are too easy to get wrong, so we
    do not support it.

IGNORED_FORM_FIELDS
    We log information about ``POST`` requests, to allow a system admin to
    go through the log and discover posts that are obviously spam
    attempts but are not caught yet and need extra handling, perhaps
    an extra form that should get protection.  This information may
    contain form fields that should be left secret or that are not
    interesting.  No matter what you fill in here, we always ignore
    fields that contain the term `password`.

ACCEPTED_LOG_LEVEL
    Log level for accepted posts.  This accepts standard lower or
    upper case log levels: debug, info, warn, warning, error,
    critical.  When an unknown level is used or the setting is empty,
    we fall back to the default: ``INFO``.

SPAMMER_LOG_LEVEL
    Log level for caught spammers.  This accepts standard lower or
    upper case log levels: debug, info, warn, warning, error,
    critical.  When an unknown level is used or the setting is empty,
    we fall back to the default: ``ERROR``.

DISALLOW_ALL_POSTS
    Set this to ``1``, ``on``, ``true``, or ``yes`` to disallow all
    ``POST`` requests.  This may be handy if you want to effectively
    make a Plone Site read-only, for example in preparation of a
    security release or when you are doing a big migration in a new
    zope instance and want to keep the old instance alive for the time
    being.  Note that, like the rest of the checks, this only has an
    effect in a Plone (or CMF) site, not in the Zope root.


When are the checks *not* done?
===============================

This package does not check fields on any ``GET`` requests, it actually blocks
the ``GET`` requests on selected forms and requires a ``POST`` there. Hence the
field checks only work on ``POST`` requests.

If you have made the ``HONEYPOT_FIELD`` configuration option empty, no
honeypot checks are done, so you only get some logging.

If Zope does any traversal, only the original action is checked.  For
example:

- A visitor makes a POST request to a ``my_form`` action.  The
  honeypot checks are done for that action.

- The ``my_form`` action may be an old-style CMF form controller
  action that calls a validation script ``validate_my_form``.  This
  validation script does *not* get honeypot checks.

- After validation, the action may do a traverse to a script
  ``do_action`` that does the real work, like changing the database or
  sending an email.  This script does *not* get honeypot checks.

As an aside, if you have such a setup, you should make sure the
``do_action`` script calls a validation script too and only accepts
``POST`` requests.  Otherwise a smart spammer can bypass the
``validate_my_form`` validation script by requesting the ``do_action``
script directly.  And he can bypass the honeypot checks by using a
``GET`` request.


z3c.form
========

You can easily add a honeypot field to a ``z3c.form``.  Just add a
``TextLine`` field to your form ``Interface`` definition, set the
``widgetFactory`` to the widget that ``collective.honeypot`` supplies,
and make it hidden.  Something like this::

  from collective.honeypot.z3cform.widget import HoneypotFieldWidget
  from z3c.form import form, interfaces
  from zope import schema
  from zope.interface import Interface

  class IHoneypot(Interface):
      # Keep field title empty so visitors do not see it.
      honeypot = schema.TextLine(title=u"", required=False)

  class MyForm(form.Form):
      fields = form.field.Fields(IHoneypot)

      def update(self):
          self.fields['honeypot'].widgetFactory = HoneypotFieldWidget
          self.fields['honeypot'].mode = interfaces.HIDDEN_MODE

See ``collective/honeypot/discussion/z3cformextender.py`` for an
example of how to extend an existing form, in this case the comment
form in ``plone.app.discussion``.


Compatibility
=============

This works on Plone 3 and Plone 4.  Specifically, it has been tested
with Plone 3.3.6, 4.0.10, 4.1.6, 4.2.7, 4.3.2.

It does *not* work on Plone 2.5.  The zope event that we hook into is
simply not fired there.
